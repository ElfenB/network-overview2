# network-overview2

This is an updated project of my [previous project](https://github.com/ElfenB/network-overview) for a network overview. This version is now based on React with Material UI and will have more advanced features.

It is structured as a monorepo. Backend and frontend share one repository.

## Usage/Examples

Deploy network-overview2 with docker compose

```shell
docker compose up -d --build
```
